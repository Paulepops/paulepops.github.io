I served with the Royal Australian Air Force for 21 years before leaving for a job with the Australian Public Service in 1998.  

I worked for the Department of Defence for a further five years before transferring to the Australian Taxation Office in 2003. I worked for the Australian Taxation Office until 2020 and then I retired!

I have been interested in website development, design and standardisation since the early 1990s.
